        This project is a tool for building and managing a company's phishing campaign as part of employee education and awareness.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        Increasing awareness among company employees of the phishing threat.
        Instilling a responsible and careful work culture in the field of phishing among employees.
        Presenting an up-to-date and reliable picture of the company's exposure to danger by mapping the behavior of employees.

        <h3>Product description, characterization and scenarios</h3>
        A website that will be a source of information and management for the phishing campaign.
        The website will allow the campaign managers to send email messages simulating an attack to employees from pre-prepared templates or
        from custom templates. The sending will be done according to the campaign manager's request.
        When an employee fails or succeeds in the phishing exercise, you will send him an appropriate message.
        In addition, the site will include data on the exercise - the number of employees who succeeded or failed in the exercise, statistics, etc.
