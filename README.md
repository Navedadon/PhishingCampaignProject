## PhishingCampaignProject


This project is a website that can manage phishing campaigns.
The main goal is to allow companies to educate their employee to behave more carefully and responsibly when opening suspicious emails.
The website allows us to add and remove targets and attackers (the ones who send the phishing mail), start new campaigns from ready templates, and track them and their stats.

### How to install locally:
This website needs python and node.js. Therefore, install them before preparing the project.
After node.js and python are installed, follow the next steps:
1) clone the project to your computer and enter the PhishingCapaignProject folder
2) In the PhishingCapaignProject folder, enter the client folder and run "npm install" to install frontend packages
3) In the PhishingCapaignProject folder, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all backend packages
4) From the PhishingCapaignProject folder, run "python main.py" to run the project
